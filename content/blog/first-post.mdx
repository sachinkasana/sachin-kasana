When optimizing payloads and runtime performance, I often use focused tools to
remove friction from the workflow. If you are working with large JSON responses,
the [JSON Prettifier](/tools/json-prettifier) helps validate and clean payloads
quickly. For debugging string-heavy payloads or log parsing, the
[Regex Tester](/tools/regex-tester) is a fast way to iterate on patterns.

If you are learning async behavior, the [JS Event Loop Visualizer](/tools/js-event-loop-visualizer)
and [Node.js Event Loop Visualizer](/tools/node-event-loop-visualizer) are great
for building intuition before profiling real apps.
